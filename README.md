# Wintertodt Warmth Alert
A warmth alert plugin for the OSRS Wintertodt skilling boss.

You can set the warmth threshold from 0-100 at which you want to be notified as well as whether you want to be notified with an overlay or tray notifications. Tray notifications will only fire if the window is out of focus.
